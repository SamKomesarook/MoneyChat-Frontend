## Current Bugs and Issues:
- The login functioanlity does not verify if the password is correct or not
  this means the user will still log in even if their password is inccorrect.
  Even though they login, the user will not successfully be able to message
  other users as they have not connected to the server correctly.

- New users can not register a new account. There is no connection between
  registration and the server. Thus users can not make a new account.

- Payments between other users is not setup at the moment. It is just the
  frontend GUI that is shows the payment
